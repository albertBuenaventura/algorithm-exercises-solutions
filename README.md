# JavaScript/TypeScript/Java/Python Algorithms and Data Structures (For Studying purposes)

## Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* [Single Linked List](data-structures/SingleLinkedList.ts)
* [Queue](data-structures/Queue.ts)
* [Stack](data-structures/Stack.ts)


## Algorithms

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

* [LongestPath using DFS](algorithms/LongestPath.ts)
* [Combinations (Recursive)](algorithms/Combinations.ts)
* [Fibonacci Sequence](algorithms/Fibonacci.ts)
